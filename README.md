gwms-dev-tools
==============

Scripts to help with deployment or management of GlideinWMS components, especially on Fermicloud.

These are tools used by the developers team and shared as-is. There is no expectation of a polished and finished product.
Comments and contributions are welcome.

You can install the aliases and functions using `fclinit` from your laptop or desktop, or locally with:
```shell
curl -L -o ~/.bash_aliases https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glideinWMS/dev-tools/master/.bash_aliases 2>/dev/null && . ~/.bash_aliases && aliases-update
```
